AllWordWSD
==========

Guidelines for adding code:
Add a folder for each of the approaches for solving All word WSD. Each of the folder should have a README file that talks
about the intuition and idea behind the approach. Also, experimental results could be made a part of the README.

About the Repo:
This repository is meant to be used for one of the assignments for the Computational Linguistics course taught by
